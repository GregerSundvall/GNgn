My game engine sand box, sorta.


Some sort of game engine. Or would game framework be more correct? My thought is someone should be able to start with this as a foundation
and just do the gameplay stuff. I don't really expect anyone to ever actually do that but I mean, that someone COULD.

It started out with testing performance in different super-simple setups of "entities". Right after that I actually had some time on my hands 
so I started fleshing out the structure around the first stuff. Then, for my degree project, I decided to research game physics which ended up 
me making a physics part to this engine. A lot of the structure I had before was removed doing this. 

Right now I'm thinking of either 
A: write the report and thereby actually finish my degree project. 
B: Make an event system for this engine. 
Choices...
